# CSP - FINAL - Proposal 
A simulation of rendered drawings forming in an algorithmic pattern across a canvas around certain anchor points.   

## Summary

The main goal of this project, is to create a canvas with a self drawing shapes around certain points of anchor. 

## Component Parts

This project will be based in react and will be on a platform on a website that people will have access to. 

## Challenges

The most time-consuming part will be the algorithmic drawing of the lines around the center main anchor points 

## Timeline
- Week 3 Feb 6th : Proposal Due
- Week 4 Have canvas drawn with anchor points
- Week 5 Begin working on algorithmic drawings by researching different methods and previous projects that have used the same concept.
- Week 6 Have somewhat of a visual on how it will look like with code. Have some code written for presentation purposes
- Week 7 Mar 5th : Proof of Concept -- exploration & research finished 
- Week 8 Most likely its not working or the code needs advancment.
- Week 9 Im stuck, so asking JD for help with every bit of this project.
- Week 10 OH MAN the working prototype is due next week. "J.D" I need your help the code isnt doing its job properly
- Week 11 Apr 2nd : Working Prototype
- Week 12 Recieve feedback and change code/visual.
- Week 13 Jesus my show is due next week and the final are in the same week IM STRESSED
- Week 14 Apr 23rd : Final Critique & Feedback Session

Voronoi Diagrams - In mathematics, a Voronoi diagram is a partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given set of objects. In the simplest case, these objects are just finitely many points in the plane (called seeds, sites, or generators).

Perlin Noise - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZEMLCnn8v0 - Perlin Noise is an extremely powerful algorithm that is used often in procedural content generation. It is especially useful for games and other visual media such as movies.

Random Walk - https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-algorithms/current/labs-algorithms/random-walk/ - is an algorithm that provides random paths in a graph. A random walk means that we start at one node, choose a neighbor to navigate to at random or based on a provided probability distribution, and then do the same from that node, keeping the resulting path in a list. Itâ€™s similar to how a drunk person traverses a city.
