## Summary

The main goal of this project, is to create a canvas with a self drawing...

## Component Parts

This project will be based in react and will be on a platform on a website that people will have access to. 

## Challenges

The most time-consuming part will be the algorithmic drawing of the lines around the center main circle points. 

## Timeline

- Week : Write the proposal and begin working on the canvas with the different shapes.

Voronoi Diagrams - In mathematics, a Voronoi diagram is a partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given set of objects. In the simplest case, these objects are just finitely many points in the plane (called seeds, sites, or generators).

Perlin Noise - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZEMLCnn8v0 - Perlin Noise is an extremely powerful algorithm that is used often in procedural content generation. It is especially useful for games and other visual media such as movies.

Random Walk - https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-algorithms/current/labs-algorithms/random-walk/ - is an algorithm that provides random paths in a graph. A random walk means that we start at one node, choose a neighbor to navigate to at random or based on a provided probability distribution, and then do the same from that node, keeping the resulting path in a list. Itâ€™s similar to how a drunk person traverses a city.
